# HotRestaurant
* Description: Basic app demonstrating Node and Express with jQuery. Overall purpose is to help schedule reservation requests. Restaurant has just 5 tables available. First five requests get a reservation, every request after that is sent to the waiting list.

## To Install
* Git Clone the repository
* Navigate to the folder where the repository exists using Git Bash or Terminal
* Run the command `npm install` to download the required dependencies
* Then run the command `node server.js` to run the program

## Notes:
* Current app doesn't have admin handling. We'll deal with that at a later time.
* Don't separate the Javascript from the HTML in the client-side code. (i.e. Dont use external Javascript. If you do, you will need an additional line of code to configure the express server to know where the javascript is).

## Good luck! Don't stress out.
* Spend some time trying to build exposure. But don't get overwhelmed. We'll have plenty of time to come back to this.
