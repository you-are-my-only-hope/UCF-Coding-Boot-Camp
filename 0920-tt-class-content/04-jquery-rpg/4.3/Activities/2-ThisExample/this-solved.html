		// What is `this` going to print?
		// ANSWER: In this case "this" references the window (since it isn't inside of any object)

		//EXAMPLE TWO
		// What is `this` going to print?
		// ANSWER: Again, in this case 'this' references the window, since it isn't tied to any specific object.

		//EXAMPLE THREE (Important)
		// What is `this.name` going to print?

		//When 'changeName' function is run it's scope is no longer inside of the 'myObj'
		//What can we do to make sure 'this' is pointing to the correct obj.

		//EXAMPLE FIVE (Bonus)
		// What is this going to print? 
		// Why did this print Blue Shell? But not the last example? 
		// Here it printed correctly because we used the self variable to hold the correct instance of 'this' 
		var myObj = {
