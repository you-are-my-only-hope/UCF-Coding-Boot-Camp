		// //alert 3
		//  Because when the code is ran lexically the function c has a property of myVar and a varible of myVar, the varaible myVar is set to undefined when the function is being read by JavaScript engine(hoisting), but when the function is called it's looking at the scope to see if it finds a variable named myVar, it alerts myVar with undefined and the function assigns myVar 3 and alerts 3
