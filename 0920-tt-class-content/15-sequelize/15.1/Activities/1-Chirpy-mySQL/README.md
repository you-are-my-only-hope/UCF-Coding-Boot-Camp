#Chirpy
Using the app skeleton provided to you:
  * Create a MySQL database named `'chirpy'` with a `'chirps'` table to hold your data.
  * Your `'chirp'` table should include a field for id, author, chirp, and time created.
  * Modify the connection.js file to create a connection to your database.
  * Modify the api-routes.js file so that there is a route for adding a new chirp, as well as retrieving all chirps.
  * Create a simple front-end for the app using HTML/JavaScript.

##Bonus
* If you finish early, work on routes for editing and deleting chirps.
