## Week 1 (Easier) Assignment - Building a Wireframe

### Overview
In this assignment, you will build a web design skeleton using HTML/CSS. Your completed work should look just like the image below:

### Student Notes

* This exercise will challenge most students unfamiliar with HTML/CSS. If you see this task as too simple, or if you finish it within three hours, attempt the second homework assignment. 

* Just because this is the "easier" assignment does not make it the "quick" one. The process of learning web development is nothing without a serious time investment. While the work may seem strenuous now, you'll find yourself becoming more comfortable with web development as you put more hours into your training.

### Instructions
1. Create a new repository in GitHub called `HW-Wireframe`.
2. Clone this repository to your computer by following the process we went over in class.
3. Navigate to the `HW-Wireframe` folder you just cloned onto your machine. Then create two files inside this folder: `index.html` and `style.css`.
4. Make your initial Git commit and push it to GitHub. 
    * `git add .`
    * `git commit -m "<COMMENT>"`
    * `git push origin master`
    * If this process was done correctly, you should see these two files appear in your repository. This will be your initial test to confirm that you're hooked into GitHub. 
5. Return to your local copies of `index.html` and `style.css`. Using the screenshot at the top of these instructions, recreate the design using HTML/CSS. 
    * All of your HTML should be inside of the `index.html` file. 
    * All of your CSS should be inside of the `style.css` file.
6. When you finish the assignment, commit your changes with Git and push them into your GitHub repo. Remember:
    * `git add .`
    * `git commit -m "<COMMENT>`
    * `git push origin master`

### Additional Specifications:
1. Your HTML should have each of the following sections: 
    * Header
    * Nav
    * Aside
    * Section
    * Article (With a Heading)
    * Headers
    * Paragraph
2. Your CSS should have styles for each of the following elements:
    * Body
    * Header, nav, and footer
    * Section
    * Aside
    * Article
    * .clear
    * Your text elements: h1, p, etc.
3. The colors used in your final layout should be:
    * Background: #777
    * Content: #ebebeb
4. The widths of each section should be:
    * body: 960px
    * section: 495px
5. The fonts used in the layout should be:
    * font-family: 'Arial', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;
    * font-size 18px


### Helpful Hints:
* For a refresher on working with Git and GitHub, consult the GitHub Supplemental Guide we sent you in class.
* Don't forget to review these concepts: `float`, `padding`, `margin`, `display`, `overflow`, `clear` and `text-align`.
* This will be a tough assignment. But 23 weeks from now, you'll look back to this exercise and realize just how much you've grown as a developer. Stay positive!
