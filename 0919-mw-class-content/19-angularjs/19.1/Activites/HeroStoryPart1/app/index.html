           Here we include the Angular JS library JS and the Angular UI-Router library.
           Angular UI-Router is not a built in angular library but makes routing much easier.
           In Angular 2, Angular adopts this concept of routing and it is included.

            A note on directory structure and organization. Keeping your Angular code organized and slim
            is really important. Following the directory structure we have defined and recommend is following
            recommendations from industry experts and larger organizations and open source projects!

            appName/
                features/ - All of our "features" of the app
                    featureName/ - Each feature gets its own space. Features can be (routes, components, services, etc)
                        featureName.directive.js - If the feature is a directive, you will have this
                        featureName.service.js - If the feature is a service, you will have this
                        featureName.controller.js - If the feature is a route/view, you will have this
                        featureName.route.js - If the feature is a route/view, you will have this
                        featureName.html - If the feature is a route/view, you will have this
                        featureName.module.js - Declare the module and its dependencies
